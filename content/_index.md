Your go-to guy for all things tech strategies and beyond. Originally from India, I've set up camp in the land down under, Australia, where I'm rocking the IT scene as a Business Technology Partner.

When I'm not decoding the tech mysteries, you'll catch me time-traveling through history, soaking in the artsy vibes, and jet-setting to explore new corners of the world. I'm also a bookworm, wordsmith, movie buff, and a doodler at heart.

I'm a productivity enthusiast, always on the lookout for smarter ways to work and live. I spill my thoughts on productivity hacks, the latest tech trends, personal finance wisdom, and design theories in my blogs.

And guess what? Teaching's my jam too! For the past many years, I've been sharing my IT wisdom with Master's students at Monash University.

Join me in this digital adventure where productivity meets creativity. Stick around for insights, musings, and a sprinkle of wanderlust, all rolled into one!
